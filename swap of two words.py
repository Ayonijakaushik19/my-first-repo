# we create a another variable  'word' to save ayu's value so that it's value doesn't  get lost
#then we assign word 1 to word 2 and then again pick ayu's value from word and assign it to word2 
# as we have word=3 rd empty vessel
#word 1=rice vessel
#word 2=pulses vessel
#and we have to exchange rice and pulses
#so we put first rice to 3rd empty vessel and put pulses to rice vessel and then take rice from empty vessel and put it in pulses vessel
